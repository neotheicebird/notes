1. I cannot agree with the termination policies (30 days wont work for me)
2. Fee structure is vague - 35$, only 20hrs and monday to friday.
3. section 4.5.2 
4. Invoicing - with a 30day clause, doesn't seem to go with upwork invoicing schedules.

Say no to agreement. 

Talk about the tone of the agreement, and how it is little bit more serious to your liking.

I am looking for a more flexible position, as I am coming out of sabatical linked to health issues.
