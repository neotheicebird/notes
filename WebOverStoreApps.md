With the advent of PWA, we can make websites "installable", better thing is we can distribute these so called apps through playstore also (not sure about ios store). 

The disadvantages of going the store route:

1. Waiting for approval
2. Web tech has come a long way and its really fast right now, making native apps not very shiny
3. quick dispatch of updates and not wait for approval
4. no gatekeepers, no commisions

Disadvantage of going PWA route:

1. Apple. They make sure PWAs are painful for their users. No audio for app in background, only 1GB of allowed space per app (200MB increments if user permits, so if app needs 2GB, user has to click allow 200mb incr 5 times, ridiculous!)
