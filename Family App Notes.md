1. Make the design language of the app such that, the themes can be changed for a family accounts. This ensures that the app is customizable to suit a family's unique qualities. We can also sell premium themes when there is tracktion and the need for this feature is proved. (think pokemon, cryptokitties)
2. Make the app free for use with the core features (events, habits, posts, ) and let the family buy premium features like spaces (or vault. where they can store files), Tracker (to geotrack family members), Games like Ludo. Basically the idea is to create a ecosystem of microapps which can be added to the bottom bar. I am also imagining the bottom bar to be pullable like a card to show more options, otherwise it will show only 4 items.
