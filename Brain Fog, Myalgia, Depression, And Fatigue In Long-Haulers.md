Myalgia - Pain in a muscle or group of muslces

Why?

Reduction in Glymphatic system function may be responsible for this outcome. 

**Important**: This means that the lymphatic system in the brain is not draining properly. Because of which there are fluids accumulation in brain, which mean cytokines accumulation, that cause long hauling system.

(4 types) fluids in brain:
1. Blood (10% of fluid in brain is in blood compartment)
2. In CSF compartment (10%)
3. Intracellular fluid (10%) - called interstitial fluid
4. CSF

There are ventricles in brain, where "things are pulled" from blood into CSF. This is an active process, needs energy. CSF produced in the center of the brain is not just present in spinal column, But, it surrounds the brain behind the meningis layer, letting the brain float. Through veins it is circulated back into body in 1 mechanism, there is another mechanism in which the CSF enters the brain tissue, bathing cells in brain, through PeriArterial space (two parallel tubes) (slowly oozing out through PA into tissue). The inflammatory particles, or proteins and other debris, are washed by this fluid away from the brain tissue into the venous system, at the cervical lymphatics and back into the circulation (this specialized lymphatic system, is called GLymphatic system).


Problem in long haulers? This Glymphatic system doesn't work properly. Why?

The reason is that the majority of the drainage happens through the veins that are near the olfactory system. Covid-19 causes the inflammation of the tissues around the olfactory nerve. Anosmia (smell blinding), caused by Covid, also causes inflammation in the nose. The Glymphatic system which drains into the sinuses and mucosa of the nose, isn't functioning properly, the washing away of debris in brain isn't happening properly and cytokines/debris are sitting in the brain. This is the cause of Brain Fog, Myalgia etc


Fix?

Fortunately a simple process. 

1. Central lymphatic draining (neck massage to drain) reduces the pressure and debris in brain
2. Move spinal cord, by means of exercises
3. Sleep well - Glymphatic system only operates when we sleep. When we are awake, brain tissue naturally swells up a bit and puts pressure on the peri-arterial and peri-venouse space and blocks the ISF (interstitial fluid) to be in the brain.
