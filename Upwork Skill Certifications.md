I was invited by upwork to attend this test and gain more value in my profile.

Preparation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX80RIQoWsY

1. What is it?

A credential displayed on upwork profile, visible to all freelancers and clients. Like "Upwork Java Back-end Development Skill Certification". There is one available for python too.

Pass rate: ~19%

2. Who is it for?

For Talent: Atleast 3 years experience in domain.
- Stand out regardless of how or where you learned
- establish credibility
- demonstrate dedication to craft

For Clients:
- Reduces screening for domain experts. Acts as a simple signal to filter freelancers
- Adds confidence to non-domain clients
- helps upwork talent specialists improve invitation relavancy

3. Perks:
- 80 connects per passed certification
- Prioritized for invitations by talent specialists
- prioritized for expert vetted program (small program)

4. Process
- Prequalified to be invited (once in 6 months, invite only, full profile needed)
	- You need to be alone in the room when taking test
	- You need to share your webcam, microphone throughout the session
- General coding assessment (GCA)
	- Coding in the language of your choice
	- 70mins (+1min grace period when we cannot edit answer, but only submit if you forgot to submit)
	- 4 questions (easy to difficult)
		- Q1: 2-3 basic concepts
		- Q2: 3-5 basic concepts
		- Q3: Implementation
		- Q4: Problem solving (finding an optimal algo or data structure)
- Skill specific test

Q1: Meant to be warm up

Fairly simple. e.g. Given an array of integers `a`, the task is to return another array `b` where `b[i] = a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i+1]` (if an element does not exist, it should be `0`)

Q2: more complex (string manipulation, built in data types)

e.g given a list of words, and a complex word written in camelCase, check if the complex word consists of words from the given list.

Q3: Aimed to measure true implementation ability

Think through of your implementation before implementing. It doens't complete in 10 to 15 lines of code, and there is a time limit, so plan and things get easier.

Q4 - Improve efficiency or optimization problem

Shouldn't take a lot of time, we just need to improve the code, think its testing refactoring skill as well

Skill Specific Test Overview

- Administered and Certified by CodeSignal
- specialized assesment based on role, language or framework
- built similar to GCA
- 7 questions
	- Q1 - Q3: problem solving
	- Q4 - Q7: Multiple choice

Q1-Q3: Very similar to GCA Q3, Q4, but tailroed towards the specialization
-	Data structures such as sets, hashmaps and trees
-	time complexity of the solution is tested
-	advanced algorithmic techniques to find optimal solution
-	framework agnostic - no react, vue

Q4-7
-	Focuses on breadth and depth of candidates knowledge about domain
-	no coding
-	e.g:
	-	Given the following 5 lines of code, what would be printed in console

Setup:
1. Proctored session (automated session, signals are generated, for sound, webcam footage)
	-	Photo ID for verification
	-	Stable internet (we dont lose the work, but lose time and also marked as a bad signal to drop off)
2. Set language (you can change it later), read the rules:
	1. We can look up language documentation and syntax but other materials are prohibited.
	2. breaking the rules fails the test
3. Go:
	1. Watch the timer
	2. You can go back and forth between questions, but people perform better when they go in sequence
	3. running code doesn't affect score (like codewars), we need to submit the answer to be accountable
	4. 1 extra min to submit code
	5. saves draft every couple of secs
	6. dont close tab, that might fail the certification (6 months till next attempt)

Questions:

1. Is there feedback when answering questions?
	Partially, in multiple choice questions - No. In programming questions, the platform says which unit test failed for visible tests, there are invisible unit tests, which just says that the solution didn't pass.
2. Any benifits to getting multiple certification?
	Right now there is only one attempt, and so one certification is only possible. But in future yes.
3. What if I miss the 2 week expiry of the invite link?
	Generally upwork sends follow up emails, but no guarentee
4. point system?
	Not displayed, upwork properiatory. So trust upwork.
5. GCA results public?
	You can share GCA results with other interviewers as that is not upwork IP. But specialized tests are upwork specific. The badge can be shared online (Like on linkedIn) but not answers
6. Can you code in IDE?
	Read the rules. Dont do local IDE. Since the way we type in, the process etc is analyzed.

I started with GCA practice tests from codesignal.com for the past 4 days, and didn't find any improvements for the first 3 days. Here are some tips, that helped me get a lot better on the 4th attempt:

1. Reading about how to crack code challenges, really helping bring in new perspective. This is where the improvement started
2. If I am using multiple for loops, and trying to think like a computer, I am doing it wrong. In today's exam, the first 3 questions worked on the first try. This is because, I refreshed my knowledge on idomatic python. I started finding out mini problems and how they are efficiently solved in python, those mini-solutions came to use in today's exam. (mini-solution e.g. `Grouping` array of int-arrays by their mean value. Use defaultdict(list) and in a for loop do `d[mean].append(l)`)
3. Important one is, I learnt that a small nap of 30 mins is great to boost cognitive ability, I took the test right after a 30-40 min nap and I didn't feel any cognitive fog, which was essential to solving better. I now understand, that high level ideas are born naturally and not really from short term. While I needed knowledge-units in short or medium term memory, a general vision for solving the problem, happened creatively, and it is important to keep the brain fresh and creatively recharged.
