Amplify allows us to launch a backend based on data modelling we do in a Editor. And then the backend can be deployed in minutes to be consumed on the clientside. Hours of work saved. (I think) the issue with doing this is we wont be able to see the backend code and be able to modify it.

This is interesting because, it reinforces the idea of creating codegens that are this much flexible, that we can do in using our own code and on AWS. With our codegens we would be able to save a whole lot of time. Really interesting.

Maybe in future, we can build a data modelling UI application, that generates Graphql schema based on best practises we identify. Also it can generate frontend code that can be used in our projects just like amplify allows us to.
