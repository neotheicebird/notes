ONe of the best explanations of the disease mechanism by an indian doctor. Key points:

1. The virus enters body cells and replicates (day 1, unknown in current wave scenario, earlier we were able to point out events like a wedding reception etc)
2. Soon the immune system recognizes the foriegn body and starts creating antibodies. It is around Day 4 or 5 that with sufficient number of anitbodies and larger viral count, the fight is maximized leading to release of a "shower" of cytokines. This causes increase in body temperatures, body pain in certain parts (myalgia), sore throat
3. It is important to note the Day 1 of the symptom, like loose motion, headache etc (not the first day you suffered)
4. In most people (80%) they become asymptotic in 3 or 4 days
5. In 20% the disease takes a dangerous turn after Day 5. 
	1. Fever that higher than before or new fever
	2. Breathing difficulty
	3. A Deep kind of cough - This is not pnemonia, rather it is the immune system attacking the lung tissue, intestine, kidney tissue, blood vessels, since some of these cells have proteins that mimic virus spike protein
6. In the dangerous phase of the disease, we need to do two things:
	1. Use steroid to suppress immune system, to reduce the cytokine storm
	2. Using anti coaglents to thin blood and reduce clotting
7. If these above medications are not given in time, there is a lot of clotting in the lungs (anti else where) which requires external oxygen support.
8. NOte: first 5 days of the disease, steriods shout NOT be used. Also steriods should be given under doctor guidance. Once the breathlessness onsets, steriods are to be given to suppress immune response, this should be done for about 10days. Early suppression of immunity, leads to more viral multiplication and body damage, so timing is important with steriods.
9. Oximeter would show 100% saturation even upto 2/3 of lungs get damaged, so do not depend on oximeter to make decisions. Instead, make it based on onset of symptoms, especially day on which breathlessness onsets, could be the day to start steriods(consult doctor)
10. Steriods make us feel good, invincible in a day or two. Dont let your guard down, soon it lets bacteria in lungs create pneumonia like symtptoms (this is the real pneumonia happening). This is the time to take anti-biotics (not at the Day 1 of symptoms, they dont help)
11. Blood thinners (anti coagulents) are to be taken for about 30 days, since clotting seems to take place for larger amount of time
12. Ivermectin, or any other medicine have no evidence to help. Remdesiver is useful only in the last few days of the 5 days after the disease took dangerous turn.
