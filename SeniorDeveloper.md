## Who is a senior developer?

People generally assume that after a few years in industry, or after passing an imaginary milestone one becomes a senior developer. But who really is a senior developer?

According to "The Software House", a senior dev is one who:

1. understands the full product life cycle and is able to navigate it
2. is able to design a system and be able to implement it
3. feels responsible for the project and the business behind it
4. if something fails in production, immediately jumps in to find a solution
5. has good soft skills and is able to talk to clients, propose solutions and act as a consultant
6. mentors and trains younger colleagues
