- Built a simple ariadne + docker compose based server
- Didn't push myself in search of trying to achieve everything. Attitude was, solve one task at a time, solve the task like it is the last task in my life. There was less anxiety than I had in past working on Jay's projects.

- Completed the frontend part and now a boiler plate with signup, login, upload profile pic is complete
- Took me about 12 hours and charged $420 (at $35/hr) to complete a this requirement
- Last week I faced a bit of anxiety, since I was spending a lot more time than I expected on the frontend, this put me in a "what would the client think?" mode. Spend 7 hours in 3 days, while I was planning for 4 to 6 hours in 2 days.
