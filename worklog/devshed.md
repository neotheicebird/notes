First week

- Choose a stack for devshed (Flask+Docker/AWS+Mongo). Took 4 hours of work
- Got the backend setup working with tinydb
- There is not much clarity in the requirements, so I am focusing only on tasks that are clear, but I am unsure how this is going to turn up in the future and how to get the right information from the client.

- Over the last week I built a Mongodb adapter with CQRS+ES architecture. It query's by making use of linked list nature of version, prev_version and aggregation functions. Works pretty well, not sure how good it will be in scale though. Took 12 hours to build it, 420$ charged.
