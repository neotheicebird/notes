What should this app do?

1. It could be a todo list for families. I have for sometime wanted to place a blackboard in my home, where tasks can be listed, and some common tasks can be striked off by anyone. This moves the dependency from any one person in the family and also makes others aware of what's needed to run a family.
2. We should also be able to manage events, using a calander and notification system
3. Family chatroom? (not really needed, there are better tools out there)
4. GPS based tracking of family members (hmmm... maybe overkill)
5. Habits tracking (hell yeah!)
6. General lists like wishlists. (todos and this could just form _lists_, we could design around multiple lists concept)

Who is family?

People living in the same home

Cant family be apart?

The app can be designed around home being the center point, or the relationships between people being the center? Which is a better approach? - Ans. Relationship is the center. People who are related form a group.

Ideas:

1. The app should be kid friendly and attractive to kids. Inspired by Mitchells vs the machines, use kiddish drawings to make the CSS
2. Parents should be able to give kids goddies like stickers for a task completed
