Love - Sure I can love software development, specially figuring out a neat algorithm for a problem, kinda like solving a good math problem. It just needs to be the right amount of challenge. Can't love plumbing code, but given enough challenges, I get the discipline to plumb.

Good at - I have a specific set of skills which I am good at, specially in long term projects, I can add that one percent everyday to make the product better, I can think about pitfalls and make sure that the product comes out shining, its arduous slow work, but I am good at that.

Paid for - so far I have been paid for my work, and I feel going forward these skills are in demand and I can be paid for it. Being a minimalist, my needs are also less and I am happy with the pay I have been getting in the last couple of years.

World - Does the world need more software?

This I have no answer for and I need to seriously ponder about this.

- The world is big and people can use better softwares. With the ground underneath softwares constantly evolving, like due to AI, emerging Quantum computing, softwares in general have to evolve, produce features that were'nt available in the past. Checkout microapps, 
- A future in which machines and softwares get our work done, agriculture, defense, etc would be automated, which means the software rush isn't going to end soon.

- [# Why Software Is Eating the World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)

Software is eating traditional businesses (like Amazon) that's a world trend.

The why of software?

- Every day we have one more software powered billionaire added to the world. This is disparity, division of power. Can software democratize power? (dapps?)
