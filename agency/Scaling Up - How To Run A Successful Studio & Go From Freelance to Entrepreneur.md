1. What is your time worth?

Lets say I can make a landing page for 1500$ in 30hrs, my worth is 50$/hr. The work that got into selling a landing page are (in brackets, hrs put in vs cost to the company):

	1. Finding client (2hrs = 60$)
	2. Meetings and interpreting requirements (3hrs = 90$)
	3. Developing a barebone website (10hrs = 500$)
	4. Adding Design (12hrs = 600$)
	5. Publishing on their domain (3hrs = 150$)
	
Of all these roles, which the freelancer keeps changing hats to meet the requirement, what roles can be hired? (Assume these people spend same amount of time as you do on a project to accomplish the goal, calculate cost to company as well)

	1. A web developer (25$/hr * 10 = 250$)
	2. A designer (30$/hr * 12 = 360$)
	3. DevOps for publishing (30$/hr * 3 = 90$)
	4. Sales (15$/hr * 2 = 30$)
	5. Team manager (30$ * 5 = 150)
	
	= 930$
	+ 90$ (my meetings with clients)
	
	profit = 1500 - 1020 = 480$
	
2. What would I do with my time if I go from freelancer to enterprenuer ?

		1. Vision and Planning
		2. Sales/Lead generation (no one knows my product/service as well as I do)
		3. Develop products (passive income)
		4. Marketing
		5. Team management from high level
		6. Recruiting

3. Why wont clients go directly to freelance developers and get things done for cheaper?
		1. They dont have the experitise to do this
		2. Their time is probably more valueable that mine, so they will be costing more to their company than hiring an agency
		3. No contacts
		4. No need to manage themselves
		5. Frankly, some dont care and dont want this extra work
		6. its risky

4. What is more valuable than money?
	1. Time
	2. peace of mind
	3. health
	4. reputation
	5. client happiness

5. HOT
	hand of tax is the price we pay when a product moves from one hand to another.
	
	source -> supplier -> distributor -> user
	
	seeds -> farmer -> market -> shops -> salad
	
	for each hand over the expense we should have to spend to make a salad is doubled (say). We can get seeds, farm and make our own salad to make our salads cheap. But we spend time and effort to do that.
	
6. What if you charge less than what it costs to hire others?
	1. Remember HOT principle and that the value is at the end of the value chain and not the beginning. If my skill sets is at the beginning, then ofcourse there are other players who charge more for that skill. But we should look at the value of the product at the end of the value chain and charge for that, then we should be able to hire people who charge more for a role than what I would have charged.
	2. TradeUp - Make yourself seen in the world in all your glory, then you can trade up, an existing project, leads you to higher priced ones and another win takes things higher. Do not worry about the money, and keep making good work.
