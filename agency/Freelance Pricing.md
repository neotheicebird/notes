What's a logo worth?

This question cannot be answered only based on how much time and effort it takes to build one, it depends on who is using it too. For example, Nike, would be priting their logo on millions of products, boxes and so on, so the risk involved is high and they can be charged millions for a simple logo, but a small business cannot be charged similarly, so another parameter in pricing is "value" (to the client)

> You price the client, not the job

Can a business charge more than a freelancer?

Yes. A business involves more people, there is expenses, so its ok to charge more. Like a lot more.

A freelancer charges 1.5k for a logo, there are ones who charge 500, and even a small company which charges 20k. 

This authors company charges

20-50k strategy before logo
15-30k logo
10k       messaging
10k       applications (cards, letterpads, email blasts)

So the invoice has some line item like

```
3. Logo    $ 18k 
```

Wont the clients care about the breakup of this? How many hours does it take? Why does a logo charge this much? etc?

What's a good response to the following questions?

1. What is your hourly rate?
2. If it only takes so much time, why are you charging so much more (no one cares about less)?

Example here is a famous designer drew a logo during a discussion and when the client liked it she charged $x. They were skeptical and asked, hey it only took you 30 secs to draw that, so why is it so costly? 

Her response was in the line of 'it took me a 6 figure education and 34 years of experience to do that in 30secs, so yeah I charge that' That's a bit cocky, but the logic is solid.

The logic is if I can do something fast and good, it deserves to be charged more, but in the hourly paradigm it ends up getting charged less, that's why fixed prices are better.

Most businesses value time. So if we can do something quick and good, charge MORE not less.

Paul Rand would have made a logo for Mom&Pops for a sandwich, while he would have charged a million dollars to IBM. Its because of the risk involved if things go south, its not the amount of work, its not the hours spent, its the value to the client that matters. Work with an NGO, charge them just 500$ or 0$ for an asset, whose effort if you had put into an application for 50k for a large organisation.

Why are some agencies able to charge more than others or more than a great freelancer?

Social proof. Its not _just_ about the quality of the work, its about referrals, credit history, past projects, what ever criteria makes it less risky for the client. That's what you provide by moving from freelance to a web agency, from a web agency to a registered web shop business. Its not about faking the size of an organization, its about capacity of an organization to manage risk. Risk could be quick changes, low downtime, experience takling a set of problems, knowledge etc
