provisioning

orchestration

Iac - Infrastructure as Code

Multitier architecture

repository layer

entity relationship diagram:
  - entities (customer, order)
  - attributes (name, id)
  - relationships (confirms, uses, bills to, creates)
  - cardinality

abstract class - can have a default implementation

interface - only defines methods and attributes, no implementation in itself

inheritance

composition - when we set an property of a class to an object from another class, this is called composition. Sometimes we have to wonder if we have to inherit or use a composite while designing classes.

Feature flag based development - A feature flag is a software development process used to enable or disable functionality remotely without deploying code (Skillshare product uses this)
