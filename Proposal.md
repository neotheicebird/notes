https://freelancetowin.com/ - Amazing website to learn about freelancing, especially in upwork.

3 Parts of a proposal:

1. The Personal Connection Introduction (keep it short, simple and dont try too hard)
	1. Give a personal intro that shows empathy - "I am sorry that your website was compromised" or "Your project idea sounds exciting" or "exciting to hear about your product launch" or a genuine complement etc
	2. Affirmation (Repeat back) - "I see that you are looking for a Python backend developer"
2. Proof that you can do a good job:
	1. Show off your relavant skills and dissipate one concern which clients have, which is "can this freelancer do this job?". We can do this by giving an example of our work and exploring aspects of the example that might be relavant to their project.
	2. Tour guide of the work you have done - Give a peek into your thought process. "One of my recent contributions to was for brewoptix.com which is a Inventory Management Software for Breweries
		
		A few key points to notice:
		
		- I built this with my client from scratch, where in I have spent 100s of hours building the backend infrastructure on AWS
		- My client being the software architect, many a times I was the only backend engineer in the team and I have been tested on various aspects of the cloud....
		- 
		 "
		 Answer questions like, "what makes this highlight relavant to the client?", "what did I learn from working on it?", "What makes it good, unique, standout?", "what results did it achieve, including the client was happy and rehired me", "testimonial"
	3. Give suggestions on how to solve their problem.
3. Call to action - End the proposal with a simple call to action, instead of assuming that the client will respond. The proposal should start a conversations, more than it should attempt to close a deal.
	1. Ask a simple question about the project.
	2. Invite the client to a brief call to discuss further
	3. Limit to asking one question and keep it a easy question. Keep the difficult questions for later
4. DONT DOS 
	1. Scheduling, timeline, an offer to do the work - These are stuff to discussed after knowing more about the job. Most job offers do not contain all the details the freelancer needs to make this decision.



My proposal for a canadian product startup:

Hi, Your job posting sound exciting to me, I see that you are looking for a backend developer. I am a Python Backend Developer, who has been developing Microservices based enterprise applications in AWS, for the past 3+ years. 

Please let me highlight some of my recent projects and what I learnt from them: 

- I worked as part of a small product development team for a couple of years. During this time, with the help of my client, who was also the software architect, we built products like Brewoptix, which is an inventory management software for breweries, Prolance, which is a management software for freelancer, Simplecurbside, which is a product aimed at small businesses who can add curbside delivery to their customers and a few more. 
- I mainly worked as the backend developer, but I also pitched in as a vue js developer from time to time. The development methodology was design driven and we were able to keep the codebase small and simple. We did not choose any frameworks like Django or Flask, rather we used Serverless framework which is more of a cloud provisioning tool, its also unopinionated and we ended up creating a CRUD framework for these products from scratch 
- By spending 100s of hours on various tasks including designing software with clear separation of concerns, Create RESTful APIs using API Gateway, Secure the resources using Auth0 or AWS Cognito, Create Dynamodb models and efficiently use its indexes, Use MySQL alongside Dynamodb, Use S3 to store and Process static assets, Trigger Lambdas using various cloud resources to achieve desired results, Based on usecase decide upon using SNS vs SQS for the feature, implement realtime sessions using Pusher and so on... I am now able to take clear design decisions in the face of a problem, have ideas on what blockages one might face down the road if a particular direction is taken and when there is clarity, take a solution forward without wasting time in discussions trying to over optimize the software. I have given many valuable insights to my technical manager, when I find something that they could have overlooked while defining a task. 
- By Postman based API testing, and writing clear documentations (using Apiary or just documenting in project Readmes), I was working independently from frontend developers. This allowed me to avoid unnecessary meetings and kept the development backend centered. I am also used to frontend centered development that comes with GraphQL and understand the responsibilities a backend developer has in this scenario.
- I have learnt empathy and clear communications for my fellow team mates. I try to drive conversations to fix issues rather than find blames and I am not afraid to admit if my decisions lead to some issue. Early on, I understood that one cannot always foresee the correctness of a decision. I believe that, If on an average most decisions are good, the development would be smooth and we can catch most issues before it hits production. That said, I have worked on my fair share of high priority hotfixes, that goes immediately into production and learnt some lessons there. 
- Clear version control, working in independent environments, Working in various Git Stages, Event sourcing based DB design, are some of the other skills I have learnt. 

I hope you didn't find my proposal long. I am simply excited to express my interest, since I see myself to be a good match to your needs and would love to discuss this further with you. 

Would you like to get on a brief call sometime? 

Kind Regards, 
Prash
